          <h2>Generating Adversarial Examples Based on Perceptual Visual Properties</h2>
          <p>
            Recent studies show that deep neural networks (DNN) will be affected by
            adversarial examples, and images after adding perturbation are called adversarial
            examples. Among them, adversarial samples with a large amount of perturbation
            can make the deep neural network greatly affected, but it is also easier to detect
            the difference between the adversarial samples and the original image in visual
            perception. To improve the image quality of adversarial samples, this paper proposes a general improvement method and an adversarial attack method based on
            the perceptual visual characteristics, where perceptual visual characteristics include
            spectral sensitivity and just noticeable difference (JND). Our proposed method will
            be combined with existing adversarial attack methods, showing the generality of
            our method. In addition, it can also become an adversarial attack method independently. Experiments show that our method can improve the attack performance
            of existing methods and improve the image quality of adversarial samples in some
            cases.

          <h2>Incorporating attack information into makeup to attack deep learning models</h2>
          <p>
            Machine learning has evolved very rapidly, with good results in both computer vision and
            natural language processing. There are many deep learning techniques that are used in
            everyday life of humans such as autonomous vehicles and face recognition systems.
            Nowadays, the gradual dependence of human daily life on deep neural networks can lead to
            serious consequences, so the security of neural networks becomes very important.
            Therefore, the deep neural network has obvious weaknesses. We propose a method based on
            generating a confrontation network to generate a facial makeup picture that can deceive
            the face recognition system. We hide the perturbation of the attack in the results of
            the abnormal makeup photos that humans can’t detect. The experimental results show that
            we can not only generate high-quality facial makeup images, but also our attack results
            have a high attack success rate in the face recognition system.

            The music rhythm game is currently a very popular game, and we propose to generate a
            music rhythm game spectrum based on the method of Generative Adversarial Network. The
            music is separated into two parts: the vocal and the soundtrack, which makes the
            generated spectrum closer to the real spectrum. The model consists of two concepts of
            Generative Adversarial Network: Conditional Generative Adversarial Nets (CGANs) for
            music information and Improved Wasserstein GAN (WGAN-GP) for better convergence of the

            We propose a fully automated system that converts random graffiti into a painting.
            However, this is a serious challenge because the input graffiti can be very messy and
            hide multiple objects, so finding the correlation between these repeated lines and
            multiple objects is not a simple matter. In the system, we use selective search, sparse
            coding and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), in which we use selective search to find
            the part of the object that may be the object of the graffiti; then use sparse coding to
            find the corresponding element; CNN sets the style to be converted. The final
            experimental results show that the methods we use have superior performance and produce
            artistic works.

          <p>
            In this work, we aimed to
            evaluate four kinds of rehabilitation exercises at three levels: good, average, and bad.
            We propose a novel evaluation method by learning the best feature of each class.
            The idea was to design an evaluation matrix where each entry corresponded to one level
            of one exercise. By setting the largest number in one entry, the evaluation matrix could
            be used along with the output layer of the deep learning model to infer the best feature of that exercise at
            a
            particular level.
            The evaluation score is obtained by examining the distance measure of the current feature and the best
            feature of that class.
            We also collect a new rehabilitation
            exercise dataset for the rehabilitation exercise evaluation. It contains four different
            rehabilitation
            actions at three levels, defined by rehabilitation physicians.

            The goal of this project is to compare low-resolution face images to verify that they
            are the same person. In today’s unrestricted environment, the effectiveness of face
            recognition often decreases due to posture factors, so we establish a normalization
            method to restore any face angle, thereby returning the face angle of any state to
            increase The effectiveness of face recognition. The project uses two Caffe model
            architectures: Matching-Convolutional NeuralNetwork (M-CNN) and Siamese Neural Network
            (SNN). Finally, the accuracy of the SNN model is more than 90%, which is higher than
            that of M-CNN.

            In recent years, sparse coding has been very popular in the field of computer vision and
